    <h2>The story</h2>
    <blockquote cite="alan-watts-the-story-of-the-chinese-farmer">
    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
    <p>That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
    <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.</p>
    <p>You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.</p>
    <p>The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <b class="bad">bad</b>,” and the farmer responded, <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.</p>
    <p>Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <b class="good">good</b> or <b class="bad">bad</b>.</p>
    <p><q>because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</q></p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <q><b class="good">Good</b> and <b class="bad">Bad</b> are just one perspective. Bananas are <b class="good">good</b> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <b class="good">good</b> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</q>
